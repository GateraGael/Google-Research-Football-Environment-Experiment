# Google-Research-Football-Environment-Experiment
In this repository, I will be Experimenting with Google Research Football Environment.
Football has been a passion of mine since I can remember, it is fantastic that I can use a passion of mine to continue learning about my field of study.

Had to install Google Football on my linux (ubuntu 20.04) machine as the windows installation was giving me some issues
Even with linux installation I ran into an error "No SETUP file exists" after following the step-by-step instructions in the main
repository.

Overcame the problem by installing PyGame standalone before running the pip3 install gfootball.
