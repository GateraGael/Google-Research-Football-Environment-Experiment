Game episodes are automatically stored in the 'temp/dumps' folder has a custom episode name that you can save to a textfile.
There is a python script that does the work **dump_to_txt.py**
Example:
```console
python dump_to_txt.py --trace_file=/tmp/dumps/[custom_episode_name].dump --output=[outputfilename]

```
